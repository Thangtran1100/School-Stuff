    <hr />
    <p>In this semester we will develop an online system to help a hypothetical local hospital for its
        COVID vaccination effort. The system will keep track of both patient and vaccine information for
        the hospital. In this assignment, we will focus on the vaccine part that manages vaccine information.</p>

    <p>1. List Vaccines (30pt)</p>

    <p>When the application is requested without any parameter, it displays the list of the vaccines and doses at
        the hospital as shown below:</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="#">New Vaccine</a> | <a href="#">New Doses</a></p>

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="2">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Vaccine</th>
                    <th>Doses Required</th>
                    <th>Days Between Doses</th>
                    <th>Total Doses Received</th>
                    <th>Total Doses Left</th>
                    <th>&nbsp;</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Pfizer/BioNTech</td>
                    <td>2</td>
                    <td>21</td>
                    <td>10000</td>
                    <td>10000</td>
                    <td><a href="#">Edit</a></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Johnson &amp; Johnson</td>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td></td>
                    <td>5000</td>
                    <td>5000</td>
                    <td><a href="#">Edit</a></td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
    </div>

    <p>For each vaccine, the system displays the name of the vaccine, the number of doses required
        to fully vaccinate a patient, the number of days between doses if
        more than one dose is required, the total doses the hospital has received, and the total doses left (i.e. not
        yet given to patients).</p>
    <p>Most COVID vaccines require 2 doses to fully vaccinate a patient, and the
        2 doses need to be separated by a period of time. For example: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pfizer/BioNTech: 21 days</li>
        <li>Moderna: 28 days</li>
        <li>AstraZeneca: 4-12 Weeks (to keep our system simple, we'll say it 28 days)</li>
        <li>SinoVac: 28 days</li>
        <li>Sputnik V: 31 days</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The most notable exception currently is Johnson &amp; Johnson, which only requires one dose.</p>

    <p><em>Total Doses Left</em> will be calculated as <em>Total Doses Received - Doses Given to
            Patients</em>. We will implement the patient part of the system in future assignments; in this
        assignment you can keep Total Doses Left the same as Total Doses Received.</p>

    <p>2. New Vaccine (30pt)</p>

    <p>Suppose the hospital receives a new type of vaccine, a user can add it to the system by clicking on
        <em>New Vaccine</em>, which will take the user to a page where a new vaccine can be added. For
        example:
    </p>

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="2">
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <th>Name</th>
                    <td><input type="text" /></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Doses Required</th>
                    <td><select>
                            <option>2</option>
                            <option>1</option>
                        </select>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Days Between Doses</th>
                    <td><input type="text"></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td colspan="2" scope="row"><button>Add</button></td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
    </div>

    <p>Note that after a new type of vaccine is added, the application should redirect the user to the vaccine listing
        page. The Total Doses Received/Left of the new vaccine should be 0 as new doses will be added using the
        <em>New Doses</em> function.
    </p>

    <p>3. New Doses (30pt) </p>

    <p>Suppose the hospital receives a new shipment of vaccine doses, a user can add it to the system by clicking on
        <em>New Doses</em>, which will take the user to a page where the new number of doses can be added. For
        example:
    </p>

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="2">
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <th>Vaccine</th>
                    <td><select>
                            <option>Pfizer/BioNTech</option>
                            <option>Johnson & Johnson</option>
                        </select>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>New Doses Received</th>
                    <td><input type="text"></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td colspan="2" scope="row"><button>Add</button></td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
    </div>

    <p>Note that the dropdown list must be dynamically generated based on the vaccines currently in the system.
        In other words, if a new vaccine was added using the <em>New Vaccine</em> function, it should be listed in the
        dropdown list.</p>
    <p>After new doses are added, the application should redirect the user to the vaccine listing page, and
        the Total Doses Received/Left of the vaccine should be updated with the new doses added.
    </p>

    <p>4. Edit Vaccine (30pt)</p>

    <p>Clicking on the <em>Edit</em> link of a vaccine allows a user to edit the information about the
        vaccine (but not the doses). For example:</p>

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="2">
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <th>Name</th>
                    <td><input type="text" value="Johnson & Johnson" /></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Doses Required</th>
                    <td><select>
                            <option>2</option>
                            <option selected>1</option>
                        </select>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Days Between Doses</th>
                    <td><input type="text"></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td colspan="2" scope="row"><button>Save</button></td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
    </div>

    <p>Note that the form should be pre-filled with the vaccine information to be edited. In particular, the required
        doses should be selected in the dropdown list. After a vaccine is edited, the application
        should redirect the user to the vaccine listing page.</p>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>As I said in class, the vast majority of web applications can be considered as <em>data + operations on the
            data</em>, so first identify the data in this application and create the corresponding classes (e.g. Vaccine),
            then identify the operations in this application, e.g. display vaccines, add vaccine, add doses, and so on.</li>
        <li>Create one servlet for each operation. If an operation involves form processing, use <code>doGet()</code>
            to display the form and <code>doPost()</code> to process the form.</li>
        <li>To focus on the main functionality, we will assume that the users will always provide proper input - in
            other words, you do not need to implement any input validation.</li>
        <li>Changes made by the users (e.g. new vaccines and doses) need to be stored in application scope but do not
            need to be saved to a file. Those changes will be lost after the application is unloaded or reloaded, and
            that's OK for this assignment.</li>
        <li>Do not spend too much time beautifying the user interface - you can do that in later assignments when we use
            JSP.</li>
    </ul>
